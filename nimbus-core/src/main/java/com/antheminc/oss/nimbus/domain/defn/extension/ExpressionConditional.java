/**
 * <p>
 * &#64;{@code ExpressionConditional} is an extension capability provided by the
 * framework. The annotation is used to conditionally apply logic using SpEL
 * commands based on a SpEL condition. The Framework provides default event
 * handling for this annotation during the {@code onStateChange} and
 * {@code onStateLoad} events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following sample code shows how to configure a field using
 * &#64;{@code ExpressionConditional} by setting the state of the param
 * represented by {@code initDateOnLoad} based only on initial loading of the
 * param.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;ExpressionConditional(when = "null == state && onLoad()", then = "setState(T(java.time.LocalDate).now())")
 * private LocalDate initDateOnLoad;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given that &#64;{@code ExpressionConditional} is extremely versatile, misuse
 * of the annotation could result in unexpected behavior from within the
 * framework. As such, the access to the context param in the {@code then}
 * condition has been restricted to provide access to a subset of itâ€™s methods.
 * The methods available to be used can be identified by reviewing
 * {@link EntityStateHolder}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be triggered for multiple events by providing one or more
 * &#64;{@code ExpressionConditional} annotations.
